### Summary

In my case, I realize User Status is important on the way. That is not enough which is using just `Condition`,
so I'm late but I separate User Status four, `NOT_YET_MATCHED`, `ON_FINDING`, `ON_MATCHING`, `ON_TOGEHTER`
 
the other focus is apply MVP Pattern, the advantage of MVP Pattern is I can change my view model easily.

and finally I try to data every data keeps always up-to-date

And also, using Interface and Abstract class I try to keep every class has recycleable and reuse.

I really hope this code helps even a little.
